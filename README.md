# EcoDs18b20
 
 Library for the DS18B20, under development and without guarantee.

 For now, it only works for one sensor


## TODO:

* Add corrected value into the library

```
float ds18b20_corrected(float *temperature, float rawLow, float referenceLow, float rawRange, float referenceRange){}
```
